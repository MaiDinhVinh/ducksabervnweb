Over 7,000 hours and 1,000 pages of Java theory have not just taught me how to code, they have transformed me into a persistent individual, with quite focus and deep curiosity. From Oracle Certifications and A-Level Further Math, I have developed a passion for Java and Artificial Intelligence that I now share through self-initiated projects to inspire others.
